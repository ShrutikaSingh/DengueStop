# DengueStop

## Currently this is in Android on the way to refactoring in React-Native :)


An estimated 400 million dengue infections occur worldwide each year, with about 96 million resulting in illness. DengueStop Community App is a step towards saving millions of lives by preventing the spread of dengue along with raising awareness among people to eradicate it.

The idea is to develop a react-native app for tracking dengue spread that will help in finding the route of spread long with from where did it originate, linking patientâ€™s medical history to help doctors, finding nearby medical facilities of dengue in the area, creating awareness through tutorials, designing a Machine Learning bot to predict and suggest medications and also refer govt. medical schemes, giving a count of patients, and also ask a friend for migrants i.e referring the doctors to migrants and get a star ratings and many more to solve all the problems faced by dengue patents and eradicate it.
